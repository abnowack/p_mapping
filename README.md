# p_mapping
Map P (fission probability) over geometries

TODO:  
☐ Plot 2D Distributions of p including phi  
☐ Create a Cylindrical Geometry  
☐ Plot 2D Distribution for Clyindrical Geometry  
☐ Add neutron block of reflector tangent to Spherical and Cylindrical Geometry  
☐ Plot enchancement of p due to reflector
